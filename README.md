# Strugglers-ORM-Challenge

## Description
In this module, we were supposed to build a back end application that keeps track of a generic E-Commerce back end information like Categories, Tags and Products . Using Inquirer and Mysql databases, combined with the help of the Insomnia application, I was able to create,post and update new information that matches the customers needs.
